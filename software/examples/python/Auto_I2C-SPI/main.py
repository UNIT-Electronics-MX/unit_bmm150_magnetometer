# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT HARDWARE NOTICE ‚Äì BMM150 I2C/SPI interface
#
# The BMM150 sensor cannot use I2C and SPI simultaneously, as the SDO and CS pins are shared
# between both interfaces and behave differently depending on wiring.
#
# üî∏ If CS is tied to GND, the sensor enters SPI mode and will not respond to I2C commands.
# üî∏ If CS is high or floating (with pull-up), the sensor is in I2C mode.
# üî∏ Having both I2C and SPI buses physically connected at the same time may cause signal interference,
#     especially if SPI pins (MOSI, MISO, SCK, CS) are active while the sensor is in I2C mode.
#
# ‚úÖ Recommended best practices:
# - Disconnect the SPI bus when using I2C (or add 1kŒ© series resistors to reduce interference).
# - Use jumpers or DIP switches to toggle between I2C and SPI mode.
# - Never connect both I2C and SPI to the same sensor module simultaneously unless using isolation.
#
# This is especially important when using auto-detection between I2C and SPI.
